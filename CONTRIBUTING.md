# Contributing Guide For Heroku Release Phase CNB

This page lists the operational governance model of this project, as well as the recommendations and requirements for how to best contribute to Heroku Release Phase CNB. We strive to obey these as best as possible. As always, thanks for contributing â€“ we hope these guidelines make it easier and shed some light on our approach and processes.

# Governance Model

## Salesforce Sponsored

The intent and goal of open sourcing this project is to increase the contributor and user base. However, only Salesforce employees will be given `admin` rights and will be the final arbitrars of what contributions are accepted or not.

# Issues, requests & ideas

This project is in an early experimental phase, and so we are not yet ready to support and accept community contributions.
